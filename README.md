This is my study project in which I use Spring (Boot, MVC, ORM, Hibernate, Security). The datebase is PostgreSQL.
The main function of the service is to place an order by the user. Also there is an administrator role that can 
add, delete, update new product in system, and view all orders. App has authorization that shares rights between user 
and administrator. There are many code smells, when I created this project I didn't think about rules of clean code.
